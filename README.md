# Renewable-Energy-Stocks

NOTE: This project is still a work-in-progress.

Hypothesis: Increases in renewable energy prices are associated with a Democrat winning the presidential election, as Democrats are more likely to support policies that increase funding and contracts for notable renewable energy companies.

Essentially, I track stock prices of prominent renewable energy companies leading up to and after Biden's win in the 2020 election. This analysis includes polling data that indicate Biden's chance of winning up to the election, and uses Granger Causality and VAR to model stock volatility.
